## 2. Selection Rules

- Text selection can be expanded or reduced by using Shift + Arrow keys.
- Double-click selects the current word.

## 3. Multi-Cursor Support

- Ctrl + Click adds a new cursor at the clicked position.

- Editing with multiple cursors simultaneously applies changes at all cursor positions.

## 4. Auto Indentation

- Pressing Enter inserts a new line with the same indentation level as the previous line.
- When typing `{`, `(`, or `[`, the editor auto-indents the next line.
- Pressing Backspace at the start of an indented line removes indentation.

## 5. Special Cases

- Pressing Delete removes characters to the right of the cursor.
- Pressing Backspace removes characters to the left of the cursor.

## 6. Undo / Redo
